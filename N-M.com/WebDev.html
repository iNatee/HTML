                        which has impressive functionality such as E-Commerce, I can create it using a more simple site-development tool like Wordpress, which even allows the developer to insert their own custom code in the backend meaning you're not
                        sacrificing too much in terms of functionality. However, if you're more interested in a code-based site, you'll be pleased to learn this is my speciality. Having worked in a team to develop websites as wel as solo projects like this one.
